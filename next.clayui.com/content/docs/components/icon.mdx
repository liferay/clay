## Best Pratices

For Icons, we use SVG elements that link to an SVG sprite. So, it becomes necessary to pass a parameter that points to a path where this [`spritemap`](#api-spritemap) is located.

- See the complete list of symbols and flags that are offered by Clay's spritemap [here](/docs/components/icons.html)

### Using Context

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-info">
    For V3, an API was added to utilize context for passing spritemap down instead of having to pass the prop everywhere.
</div>

Just import `ClayIconSpriteContext` from the package and use your provider.

<IconWithContext />

## API
