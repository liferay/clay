## Best Pratices

For Icons, we use SVG elements that link to an SVG sprite. So, it becomes necessary to pass a parameter that points to a path where this [`spritemap`](#api-spritemap) is located.
If you are using the spritemap from `@clayui/css` you can download that svg [here](https://github.com/liferay/clay/blob/master/next.clayui.com/static/images/icons/icons.svg).

- See the complete list of symbols and flags that are offered by Clay's spritemap [here](/docs/components/icons.html)

<Icon />

### Using Context

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-info">
    For V3, an API was added to utilize context for passing spritemap down instead of having to pass the prop everywhere.
</div>

Add `import { ClayIconSpriteContext } from "@clayui/icon"` use the context as a provider. `<ClayIconSpriteContext.Provider value="path/to/sprite.svg">`.

<IconWithContext />
