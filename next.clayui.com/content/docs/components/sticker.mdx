</div>

Use stickers to visually identify elements in a dataset that are part of the same group. Stickers can be any color. Set sticker's color using [`displayType`](#api-displayType) property.

Also, you can use the following sizes on your Sticker just setting up [`size`](#api-size):

<StickerColorsAndSizes />

You can set a desired alignment of sticker according to a parent element, just setting up the [`position`](#api-position) property. If you want to set the position of the sticker on the outside corners, use [`outside`](#api-outside) property in conjunction with [`position`](#api-position) property.

Overlay content over stickers by nesting `sticker-overlay` elements as children of ClaySticker. Check our example on [Storybook](https://storybook-clayui.netlify.com/?path=/story/claysticker--overlay)

### User Icon

Use a ClaySticker as User Icon just adding `sticker-user-icon` on className of the `ClaySticker` component like the example below:

<StickerUserIcon />
