## What is Clay?

Clay is an extensive Component Library, where you'll find useful components—with extensive code examples—for your web application.

It is composed by 3 different layers, each one of these is really easy to understand and fit perfectly for every need, allowing the developer to choose what to use without limitations

	<table class="table table-autofit ">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td class="table-cell-expand font-weight-bold">Advanced</td>
				<td class="table-cell-expand">This is the final layer, ready to be used in your project with minimum customization and effort</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="font-weight-bold">Standard</td>
				<td class="table-cell-expand">Built with React, this layer rapresent the right option for those who need an advanced set of components without any limitation</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="font-weight-bold">Simple</td>
				<td class="table-cell-expand">Composed by HTML and CSS this is the perfect layer for those who want to use Clay as a simple library for their projects</td>

## Bootstrap

Clay is based on bootstrap, this means it has a very solid foundation and it is easy to use because you are already familiar with it and it follows the same patterns..
