## What is Clay?

Clay is an extensive Component Library, where you'll find useful components—with extensive code examples—for your web application.

It is composed by 3 different layers, each one easy to understand and designed to fit different needs, allowing the developer to choose what to use without limitations

<div class="table-responsive mt-4">
	<table class="table table-autofit ">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td class="table-cell-expand font-weight-bold">Advanced</td>
				<td class="table-cell-expand">This is the final layer, ready to be used in your project with minimum customization and effort</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="font-weight-bold">Standard</td>
				<td class="table-cell-expand">Built with React, this layer represents the right option for those who need an advanced set of components without any limitation</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="font-weight-bold">Simple</td>
				<td class="table-cell-expand">Composed by HTML and CSS this is the perfect layer for those who want to use Clay as a simple library for their projects</td>
			</tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

## Bootstrap

Clay is based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). This means it has a very solid foundation and it is easy to use because you are already familiar with it and it follows the same general patterns.

## Lexicon

Because Clay is modeled after [Lexicon](https://liferay.design/lexicon/)'s experience language, you can rest assured that your web application will have a consistent style and user experience.

## Customizable 100%

Clay's powerful [SCSS foundation](https://next.clayui.com/docs/css/scss.html) allows you to create your own customizations easily.

## React

Built with [React](https://reactjs.org) to reduce the learning curve and simplify the integration with your other React projects.
