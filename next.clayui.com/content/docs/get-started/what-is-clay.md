Clay is an extensive Component Library, where you'll find useful components—with extensive code examples—for your web application.

It is composed by 3 different layers, each one easy to understand and designed to fit different needs, allowing the developer to choose what to use without limitations

#### Bootstrap

Clay is based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com). This means it has a very solid foundation and it is easy to use because you are already familiar with it and it follows the same general patterns.

#### Lexicon

Because Clay is modeled after [Lexicon](https://liferay.design/lexicon/)'s experience language, you can rest assured that your web application will have a consistent style and user experience.

#### Customizable 100%

Clay's powerful [SCSS foundation](https://next.clayui.com/docs/css/scss.html) allows you to create your own customizations easily.

#### React

Built with [React](https://reactjs.org) to reduce the learning curve and simplify the integration with your other React projects.
