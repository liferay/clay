Clay is constantly evolving and creating new components. The status of each package is shown in the corresponding documentation, to be sure about the progress of the packages and to know which ones are safe to use.

You can help us by testing these components when we are working to make it stable, as long as you are prepared for changes. We appreciate your contributions to let a Beta component go to the Stable version.</td>
