1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/liferay/clay.git
```

2. Download and install the latest lts version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for your operating system.

3. Install the required global dependencies:

```
npm install -g yarn
```

4. Install the project's dependencies:

```
yarn
```

4. Install the dependencies for each package and link them together:

```
yarn lerna
```

5. Build all packages:

```
yarn build
```

6. Compile all `clay-css` files and start the storybook server:

```
yarn workspace @clayui/css run build && yarn storybook
```

> Additionally, you can run the tests for all packages with the following command:

```
yarn test
```

## Troubleshooting Setup

The latest version of Python that is supported to build Clay locally is 3.10. There is an error when setting up the Clay project with Python 3.12.

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'
gyp ERR! configure error
gyp ERR! stack Error: gyp failed with exit code: 1
gyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.onCpExit (/clay/node_modules/node-gyp/lib/configure.js:325:16)
gyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.emit (node:events:519:28)
gyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess._handle.onexit (node:internal/child_process:294:12)
gyp ERR! System Darwin 20.6.0
gyp ERR! command "/usr/local/bin/node" "/clay/node_modules/.bin/node-gyp" "rebuild"
gyp ERR! cwd /clay/node_modules/deasync
gyp ERR! node -v v20.15.1
```

You will need to switch to Python 3.10. Instructions for switching Python versions:

### Linux

https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-switch-between-python-versions-on-fedora-linux

### UNIX/MACOS

https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv

Once you are running the correct Python version, you need to clear the cache in the `/node_modules/` directory.

`rm -rf node_modules`

You should also clear the `/node_modules/` directory in Clay CSS.

`rm -rf packages/clay-css/node_modules`

Then re-run `yarn` in the `/clay/` directory and in `/packages/clay-css/`.

## clayui.com
