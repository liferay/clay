## About
This is the repo of Liferay's Lexicon Design Language, and an implementation of that design language based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

They are meant to help explain our design principles, offer direction and best practices in building your web apps, and provide a documented HTML and CSS API.

You can view the guidelines on [the Lexicon site](https://liferay.github.io/lexicon).

## Building
If you would like to contribute to the guidelines, or make changes on your system you need to do the following:

### Clone the repo
Clone the repo to your computer

### Install Node.js and NPM
If you don't already have it installed. You can find more info here: http://nodejs.org/
Node and NPM come bundled together, so you only need to install one package.

### Install the NPM modules
Run `npm install` inside of the `lexicon` directory

### Modify files in src/
The files are generated from the `src/` directory, however, most of the files you'd be interested in changing are in `src/content/`. Files can be either HTML (`.html`) or Markdown (`.md`).
Every file in `src/content/` has a heading at the top in YAML format that looks something like:


    ---
    title: Title of the Page
    ---

This section has a couple of options that can be leveraged for different purposes. Those will be covered below.

### Build the static files
Run `gulp build` to generate the static files.

### View the files
The generated files are placed into the `build/` directory.
Sass files in the `.scss` format are generated to CSS, Markdown files with the extension of `.md` are generated to HTML, and HTML files have one bit of processing applied, which is that HTML inside of triple ticks is escaped, like so:

    ```
	<div>Foo</div>
    ```

### File Heading Options
There are a couple of properties you can add to the headings of files, only one of which is required:

`title:`: **(Required)** This is used for the title of the page in the heading and in the navigation sidebar

`navIndex:`:  The navigation is sorted alphabetically by default, but if you pass a `navIndex:` property, it will manually sort the item into that position.
The property is any number, with `0` as the first position, but you can also pass in a keyword of `last` to force an item to the end.

`section:`: If you want to group multiple files into sections, in each of those files, pass the same title to the `section:` property. That title will be used for the section heading, and the files will be sorted in there. The `navIndex:` property works inside of sections as well.

### Available Build Tasks
You can pass these options when running `gulp`.

`build`: This is the default task, so running just `gulp` will fire off the build task.
This will generate all of the HTML/CSS/etc into the `build/` directory.

`watch`: Because running a script after every change can get tedious, run `gulp watch` to rebuild the files automatically as you change files.

`server`: Starts a local server on port 3000 and also runs the watch task.

`release`: This task will create a zip file located in the root of the repo with the version number located in the package.json.
We use this to deploy into Liferay.

`toc`: If you add a section to the README file, running `gulp toc` will generate a new table of contents.
