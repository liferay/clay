## Examples

We have several examples on the [site](https://clayui.com/docs/components/alerts.html). Here's the first one to get you started:

```soy
{call ClayButton.render}
    {param label: 'Primary' /}
    {param type: 'button' /}
{/call}
```

This example render a "Primary" button on the page, following [Lexicon](https://lexicondesign.io/docs/patterns/buttons.html) patterns.

You will notice that we use a [Soy (Closure templates)](https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/docs/commands) template system that is built on top of [Metal.js](http://metaljs.com/), but if you do not feel comfortable feel free to use WebComponents üòâ.

```html
<clay-button label="Primary" type="button"></clay-button>
```
It will do the same.

Each package contains a page with demos, check.

## Installation

Clay is available as the `clay` package in npm for components and for css like `clay-css`. It is also available on a [CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/clay/lib/js/clay.js) for components and for css, [check](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/clay/lib/css/atlas.css). But if you just want the separate components, it's also available in the npm as [clay-](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=clay-).

See the [Getting Started](https://clayui.com/docs/getting-started/introduction.html) guide for more information.

Even if your application does not use the framework [Metal.js](https://metaljs.com/) Clay is flexible and can be used as WebComponents see some examples with:

* [Angular](examples/angular-with-clay)
* [React](examples/react-with-clay)
* [Vue](examples/vue-with-clay)
