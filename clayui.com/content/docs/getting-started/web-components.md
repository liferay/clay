<article id="web-components">

Clay is highly flexible, so you can use the components in different applications with frameworks such as Angular, Vue, and React. Feel free to apply the Clay standards in your application.

## Introduction

[WebComponents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components) is a web standard that is to be natively implemented in browsers in the future, so do not worry if you want to go that route. Clay gives you the ability to use the components as Custom Elements in your HTML markup.

## Installation

You can start by choosing how to import your component: by [npm](/docs/getting-started/importing-the-js-component.html) or [CDN](/docs/getting-started/introduction.html). You need to import the javascript of the component into your application in order for Clay to be included and rendered as a WebComponent component.

## Using

Once you import your component into your application, you just use it as an HTML TAG. Consider:

```html
<clay-button label="Primary" type="button"></clay-button>
```

## Examples

We have created some example use cases in applications for `React`, `Vue`, and `Angular` for you to follow.

* [Angular](https://github.com/liferay/clay/tree/master/examples/angular-with-clay)
* [React](https://github.com/liferay/clay/tree/master/examples/react-with-clay)
