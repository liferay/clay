Feel free to choose a specific version of the [CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/clay) if you want to keep track of the changes we make. If, instead, you want to use the most up to date version of Clay, follow the instructions in the next section.

## CSS

> To load our Atlas skin, use any of the available automatic CDN distributions and copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets.

```text/html

```

## JS

> If you want to go beyond the static HTML, add our bundled library to get access to the full power of Clay!
