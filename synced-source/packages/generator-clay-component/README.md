# Clay component Generator

> A Yeoman Generator that scaffolds a `clay` component package.

## Install

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) from [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/):

```sh
[sudo] npm install -g yo
```

Then, install this generator:

```sh
[sudo] npm install -g generator-clay-component
```

## Usage

Just run the following command on the directory you wish to use for your project:

```sh
yo clay-component
```

The generator will ask you a few questions about the package. Once you've answered all of them it will automatically generate a starting structure for you, as well as download all the local dependencies.

_Note: This generator is intended to be used from the root level of the `clay` repository._
