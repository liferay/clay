Here's a set of guidelines to contribute to Clay and its packages. Use your common sense, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

The Clay repository follows the monorepo approach; the pillars of Clay, all the major components, are in this one repository.

-   [css](https://github.com/liferay/clay/blob/master/packages/clay-css) - Provides the colors and structure for Clay. It contains the CSS and example HTML markup for each component.
-   [components](https://github.com/liferay/clay/blob/master/packages) - The components that follow clay-css markup and Lexicon use cases. They are developed on React.js in version 3.x.
-   [clayui.com](https://github.com/liferay/clay/blob/master/clayui.com) - Contains the source code and documentation for clayui.com.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section shows you how to submit an error report to Clay. Follow these guidelines so maintainers can clearly understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

-   **Check [existing issues](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+repo%3Aliferay%2Fclay)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [Github issues](https://github.com/liferay/clay/issues). Create an issue, and provide the information listed below so the maintainers can reproduce the problem:

-   **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue that identifies the problem.
-   **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
-   **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps**, and explain the problem with that behavior.
-   **Explain the desired behavior you expected and why.**
-   **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** if necessary.
-   **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a [CPU profile capture](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/rendering-tools/js-execution) with your report.
-   **If the problem only occurs in a specific browser**, specify the name and version of the browser.

Provide more context by answering this question:

-   **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how frequently the problem occurs and under which conditions it normally happens.

### Your First Pull Request

If you want to contribute to this project but you don't know where to begin, issues with the "[good first issue](https://github.com/liferay/clay/labels/good%20first%20issue)" label are a great place to start.

If you decide to fix an issue, please check the comment thread first to make sure that no one else is working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don’t duplicate your effort.

### Proposing a Change

This section shows you how to propose a public API change, make non-trivial changes to the implementation, or propose something new. Follow these guidelines so maintainers can clearly understand your suggestion and your point of view.

#### Before Submitting a Suggestion for Improvement

-   **Check existing suggestions** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit a Suggestion for Improvement?

Suggestions for enhancement or API changes are tracked as [Github issues](https://github.com/liferay/clay/issues). Create an issue in this repository and provide the following information:

-   **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue that states your suggestion.
-   **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible.
-   **Describe the current behavior**, and explain the behavior you want to see instead and why.
-   **Provide details of the impact your change will make** and how you will use it.
-   **Provide the pros and cons of your change.**
-   **Provide at least one alternative for your change.**

### Sending a Pull Request

This section shows you how to send a pull request. The main staff are always monitoring pull requests, so rest assured that they will review yours. Follow these guidelines so the maintainers can complete a thorough review of your request.

> Be sure to check the accessibility tab of the Storybook to ensure accessibility tests are going pass.

#### Before Sending a Pull Request

-   Fork the repository and create your branch from **master**.
-   Run `yarn` at the root of the repository to install the project dependencies.
-   Run `yarn build` to build all packages.
-   **If you’ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!**
-   Run `yarn test` to ensure the test suite passes.
-   Run `yarn format` to format your code with Prettier.
-   Run `yarn lint` to make sure your code lints.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

This section shows you how to write commit messages in Clay. Follow these guidelines to help us maintain order and make it easier to locate your changes.

Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope, a jira ticket number and a subject:

```
<type>(<scope>): <jira ticket number> <subject>
```

The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.

> Clay follows the "[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)" specification.

#### Type

-   **feat**: A new feature
-   **fix**: A bug fix
-   **docs**: Documentation-only changes
-   **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-   **chore**: Changes in the build process, auxiliary tools, libraries, tests or formatting

#### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `feat(@clayui/dropdown)`, `feat(@clayui/css)`, `fix(clayui.com)`, `docs(Badge)`, `fix(useCache)`, etc...

#### Jira Ticket Number

At present, we are exclusively utilizing LPD tickets for management. [Link for How To Open a LPD Ticket to Clay](https://liferay.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PEDS/pages/2391179332/Clay+New+Process)

### JavaScript Style Guide

All JavaScript must adhere to the [Liferay JavaScript style guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-liferay).

### CSS Guidelines

See guidelines for [contribution with CSS](https://github.com/liferay/clay/blob/master/packages/clay-css/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Documentation Style Guide

Clay uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), obviating the need to write explicit [JSDOC](http://usejsdoc.org/) annotations for parameter and return types. We still write descriptions, however, for `interface`, `type`, `enum` etc to make it easier to use components.

```typescript
interface IProps {
	/**
	 * Default position of menu element. Values come from `metal-position`.
	 */
	alignmentPosition?: number;
}
```
