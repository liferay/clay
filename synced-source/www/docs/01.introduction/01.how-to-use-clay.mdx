description: 'Practical guidelines to start using Clay, a quick guide on how to install components and css to get started.'
---

Clay follows some fundamentals and we recommend that you read more about this before you start using it in your application.

-   [Composing](https://clayui.com/docs/introduction/composition)

## Install with NPM or Yarn

Clay makes the components and CSS available in its own `@clayui` scope, for example the card package is available through `@clayui/card` and the css is available through `@clayui/css`. In some packages we expose multiple components, for example the `@clayui/form` package contains components `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Input`, `Select`...

You can check out the full list of [packages available in NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40clayui).

### NPM

```shell
npm install @clayui/css @clayui/{PACKAGE_NAME}
```

### Yarn

```shell
yarn add @clayui/css @clayui/{PACKAGE_NAME}
```

> **_Important Note: Be Mindful of the Asterisk:_**
> When using the `@clayui/*` command for installation, it's crucial to remember that the asterisk (\*) is a placeholder. It's not a valid package name on its own. To install a specific Clay package, you must replace the asterisk with the name of the package you require.
>
> For instance, if you want to install the "Clay Button" package, the correct command would be:
>
> ```shell
> npm install @clayui/button or yarn add @clayui/button
> ```

## Install via Clay CSS CDN

We provide Clay CSS via CDN, which is an option when you do not want to install the clay package via NPM or Yarn.

```html
<link
	rel="stylesheet"
	href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@clayui/css/lib/css/atlas.css"
/>
```

If you want a specific version of CSS, specify the desired version.

Example:

```html
<link
	rel="stylesheet"
	href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@clayui/css@3.0.0/lib/css/atlas.css"
/>
```

## Quick start

<div className="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	<strong className="lead">Warning</strong>
	Before you get started with this quick start, read about Clay's fundamentals
	of composition to move on. The information below is assuming you have read about
	Clay's compositional philosophy and learned about the terms.
</div>

<div className="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	<strong className="lead">Warning</strong>
	This quick start requires that you have a minimum knowledge of [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html),
	not much of your API's will be used but just [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate)
	to control the component.
</div>

<div className="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	<strong className="lead">Warning</strong>
	To ensure that Clay functions correctly, please remember to import the CSS package
	from `@clayui/css` into your React entrypoint component, as demonstrated in the
	example below.
</div>

For this quick start we will use [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) which does not need to install an environment on your machine.

Use the **codesandbox** below as your text editor and environment so we can follow through with the examples.

	title="quick-start-clay"
	allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; accelerometer; gyroscope; payment; ambient-light-sensor; encrypted-media; usb"
	style={{
		width: '100%',
		height: '500px',
		border: 0,
		borderRadius: '4px',
		overflow: 'hidden',
	}}
	sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
/>

Let's use the **DropDown** component `@clayui/drop-down` and understand how the compositing philosophy works for this component so you can start replicating on other components.

<div className="clay-site-alert alert alert-info">
	<strong className="lead">Info</strong>
	You can check the [ClayDropDown](https://clayui.com/docs/components/drop-down)
	package documentation for its API and usage philosophy.
</div>

Before we get started, let's import the main packages that we will use to create a low-level Drop Down with Clay components.

```jsx
import {ClayCheckbox, ClayRadio} from '@clayui/form';
import ClayButton from '@clayui/button';
import ClayDropDown from '@clayui/drop-down';
```

<div className="clay-site-alert alert alert-info">
	<strong className="lead">Info</strong>
	These packages are installed in the sandbox environment, so feel free to fork
	the environment if you want to test with other Clay components.
</div>

As you learned from [Clay's compositional philosophy](https://clayui.com/docs/introduction/composition), we are using a low-level DropDown component, as its essence is a controlled component and for that you need to control DropDown's expand state. Let's use React's [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) to control the state.

```js
const [expand, setExpand] = useState(false);
```

Soon after we can add the components to see rendered on the screen.

```jsx
<ClayDropDown
	active={expand}
	onActiveChange={setExpand}
	trigger={<ClayButton>{'Click Me'}</ClayButton>}
/>
```

At first we are seeing only ClayButton being rendered with empty DropDown, as it is a low-level component we need to compose DropDown content with other components to see a list of actions or add whatever you want inside.

Try this:

```jsx
<ClayDropDown
	active={expand}
	onActiveChange={setExpand}
	trigger={<ClayButton>{'Click Me'}</ClayButton>}
>
	<h1>Menu</h1>
</ClayDropDown>
```

Now we can compose with other Clay components and add a Checkbox and Radio to the content.

```jsx
<ClayDropDown
	active={expand}
	onActiveChange={setExpand}
	trigger={<ClayButton>{'Click Me'}</ClayButton>}
>
	<ClayDropDown.ItemList>
		<ClayDropDown.Item href="#1">Linkable</ClayDropDown.Item>
		<ClayDropDown.Item>
			<ClayCheckbox checked label="Checkbox" onChange={() => {}} />
		</ClayDropDown.Item>
		<ClayDropDown.Item>
			<ClayRadio checked label="Radio" value="radio" />
		</ClayDropDown.Item>
	</ClayDropDown.ItemList>
</ClayDropDown>
```

Low-level components in Clay allow you to compose and add your own rules, allowing you to achieve your design standards that are tied to Lexicon fundamentals. A team that follows the Lexicon team's predicted behaviors and cases can use the high-level components that help you code faster.

See the same example above being reflected in a high-level component.

```js
import ClayDropDown, {ClayDropDownWithItems} from '@clayui/drop-down';
```

```jsx
<ClayDropDownWithItems
	items={[
		{
			href: '#linkable',
			label: 'linkable',
		},
		{
			checked: true,
			label: 'Checkbox',
			type: 'checkbox',
		},
		{
			label: 'Radio',
			type: 'radio',
			value: 'radio',
		},
	]}
	trigger={<ClayButton>{'Click Me'}</ClayButton>}
/>
```

If you had problems, this is the final sandbox with all the examples described above.
