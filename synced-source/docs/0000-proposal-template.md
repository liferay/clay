## Introduction

A short description of what the feature is.

## Motivation

Describe the problems this proposal seeks to solve. What use cases does it support? Motivate why this new change would help developers.

It focuses on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation can be used to develop alternative solutions.

## Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Take examples and describe how they work. Show how your solution adds value and is better than current alternative solutions: it's cleaner, more flexible...

## Detailed design

Describe the solution design in enough detail for someone familiar with Clay to understand and for someone familiar with the implementation to be able to implement it. If a new API is involved, show the full API and its documentation comments detailing what it does.

## Effect on API resilience

API resiliency describes the changes that can be made to a public API without breaking it. Does this proposal introduce features that would become part of a public API? If so, what kinds of changes can be made without breaking the API? Can this feature be added/removed without breaking the API?

## Alternatives considered

Describe alternative approaches to addressing the same problem, and why you chose this approach instead.

## Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing Clay developers adopt it? Is this a significant change? Can we write a codemod? Should we coordinate with other projects?

## How we teach this

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this idea best presented?

When this proposal is accepted would it mean that Clay's documentation should be reorganized or changed?
