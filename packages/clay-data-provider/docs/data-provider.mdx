## Introduction

ClayDataProvider gives functionality of data caching, attempts, polling, network status and avoiding [the thundering herd problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem). It is simple and powerful because:

-   **Easy adoption**, you can incrementally use in your application and both `useResource` hook and `ClayDataProvider` component and have all the functionality available.
-   **Simple to start**, use the basics you already know or take advantage of the full set of features to get the most out of it.
-   **Built for data to reflect what users are doing in your application**, it works perfectly for cases where data changes according to user interaction.
-   **Extensible**, enjoy the single cache in only one source of truth and save data between navigations to be used in future interactions.
-   **Suspense and ErrorBoundary** do incremental adoption with `<React.Suspense />` and `<ErrorBoundary />` to the new React patterns.

## Getting started

To consume data, you can work with two different ways in React, using the `<ClayDataProvider />` component or `useResource` hook. We recommend that you use `useResource` for cases where your component has more logic to handle data, so it decreases the complexity and eliminates logic within JSX, use `<ClayDataProvider />` for simpler cases that do not have so much logic involved in the data or when you are not familiar with hooks.

<DataProvider />

### useResource hook

The vast majority of APIs are the same between `useResource` and `<ClayDataProvider />`, the difference is that there is no `notifyOnNetworkStatusChange` API in `useResource`, you control them via the `OnNetworkStatusChange` parameter when you need it.

<UseResource />

## Features

### Retry

Make attempts on a request several times when a network or server error occurs.

`fetchRetry` is easy to set up and is enabled by default with the `jitter` setting for delays between attempts by default.

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	<strong class="lead">Warning</strong>
	The values ​​contained in the code below are the default value.
</div>

<UseResourceWithJitter />

### Network Status

The DataProvider provides network status information for you if you want to create customizations in those statuses. If you are using `<ClayDataProvider />` you can enable this information by activating the `notifyOnNetworkStatusChangeAPI` prop, once activated it will cause new renderings each time the network status changes.

<DataProviderWithNetworkStatus />

Using network status with hooks is another option, it does not provide an abstraction for `loading`, `error` and `networkStatus` and all information is collected through the `onNetworkStatusChange` callback.

-   `loading` is equivalent to `networkStatus < 4`
-   `error` is equivalent to `status === 5`

<UseResourceWithNetworkStatus />

### Variables change

`variables` is an API for `GET` requests that help satisfy whether your cache will be retrieved from storage or not, this can be useful for cases where your data is formed by user interactions such as `Autocomplete`, you can still set a delay on the `fetchDelay` prop to ensure that your requests are not called every time a change of input value occurs, for example.

<UseResourceWithVariablesChange />

### Caching data

You can cache your requests so that in new user interactions a new request is no longer necessary, by default the cache is deactivated.

The cache is guided by a policy, use the `fetchPolicy` prop to enable and configure the cache according to your use case.

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	<strong class="lead">Warning</strong>
	The cache is governed by the algorithm <b>least recently used</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">
		LRU
	</a>), you can set the amount of data that will be stored using the <code class="language-text">
		storageMaxSize
	</code> API. <b>Each new query is equivalent to 1 size</b>.
</div>

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	<strong class="lead">Warning</strong>
	When <code class="language-text">suspense</code> is enabled the hook automatically
	changes the <code class="language-text">fetchPolicy</code> to <code class="language-text">
		FetchPolicy.CacheAndNetwork
	</code> if it is set to <code class="language-text">
		FetchPolicy.NoCache
	</code> so it works properly.
</div>

### Infinite loading

Using the `useResource` hook also supports paginated data, which is common in APIs to avoid large amounts of data being trafficked in just one request and decrease response time. To get this behavior you need to return the `cursor` value with the next page link in the `fetch` property.

Data is automatically aggregated as new requests are being made when the `loadMore` callback is called.

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-info">
	<strong class="lead">Info</strong>
	Calling the <code class="language-text">refetch</code> callback as an attempt
	to refresh the data will not work since the data is already aggregated.
</div>

```javascript
const {loadMore, resource} = useResource({
	fetch: async (link: string) => {
		const result = await fetch(link);
		const json = await result.json();

		return {
			cursor: json.info.next,
			items: json.results,
		};
	},
	link: 'https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character',
	variables: {limit: 10},
});
```

### Suspense and ErrorBoundary

The `useResource` hook also supports integration with `<React.Suspense />` which allows you to "suspend" the component while a request is in progress and add a component in fallback and can in some scenarios parallelize the requests. Read more about using Suspense to load data and the benefits it can bring to your application.

```javascript
const Menu = () => {
	const {resource} = useResource({
		link: 'https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character',

		// Enable Suspense integration
		suspense: true,
		variables: {limit: 10},
	});

	return (
		...
	);
};

const Root = () => (
	<React.Suspense fallback={<LoadingIndicator />}>
		<Menu />
	</React.Suspense>
);
```

If a network error happens you can also catch the error in render time using [`<ErrorBoundary />`](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#introducing-error-boundaries) and render some component as fallback when this happens and add the possibility for the component to try to recover.

```javascript
const Root = () => (
	<ErrorBoundary>
		<React.Suspense fallback={<LoadingIndicator />}>
			<Menu />
		</React.Suspense>
	</ErrorBoundary>
);
```

### Data Fetching

```javascript
const {resource} = useResource({fetch, link});
```

This is an API that replaces the `link` behavior of receiving an async function, this did not allow us to validate the cache correctly because we do not have the URL view. This API is more friendly and has a unique responsibility, you may be able to pass an async function that accepts the `link` and `options`, and return the data. `useResource` will use its async function instead of the `fetch` default.

#### Fetch

```javascript
import fetch from 'unfetch';

const App = () => {
	const {resource} = useResource({fetch, link: 'https://clay.dev'});
	// ...
};
```

### Sortable

```javascript
const {resource, sort, sortChange} = useResource({
	fetch: (link, init, sort) => {
		const url = new URL(link);

		if (sort) {
			url.searchParams.append('column', sort.column);
			url.searchParams.append('direction', sort.direction);
		}

		return fetch(url, init);
	},
	link: 'https://clay.dev',
});
```

## Advanced

### Avoiding thundering herd problem

Starting with `delay.initial`, the delay of each subsequent retry is increased exponentially, meaning it's multiplied by 2 each time. For example, if `delay.initial` is 100, additional retries will occur after delays of 200, 400, 800, etc.

With the `jitter` option enabled, delays are randomized anywhere between 0ms (instant), and 2x the configured delay. This way you get the same result on average, but with random delays.

These two features combined help alleviate [the thundering herd problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem), by distributing load during major outages. Without these strategies, when your server comes back up it will be hit by all of your clients at once, possibly causing it to go down again.

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	<strong class="lead">Warning</strong>
	The implementation of this was based on the <code class="language-text">
		apollo-link-retry
	</code> plugin for React Apollo.
</div>

### Caching data at root level

The DataProvider can be used on small components that need some data and if it is very reused by the application in other pages, it does not make sense to consult this data every time the user interacts with it in other parts of your application, you can take advantage of the root level cache, ensuring that the next user interactions in the component are with data in the cache, even if it is on other pages.

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	<strong class="lead">Warning</strong>
	The use of the <code class="language-text">storage</code> property has been deprecated
	since v3.67.0 in favor of declaring the <code class="language-text">
		<ClayProvider storageMaxSize={100} />
	</code> component in the application root to control cache state and other internal
	details.
