## Example

<LanguagePickerExample />

## Introduction

The Language Picker component is visually similar to a DropDown component but developed specifically for the user to select languages from the menu but following the [w3c accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/combobox/combobox-select-only.html) recommendations.

The Language Picker is a component based on the Picker component that provides an accessible experience for selecting languages. It follows standard accessibility patterns for a combobox-only and offers flexibility to customize the content of the options.

## Controlled and Uncontrolled component

As with any component in Clay, controlled and uncontrolled components are the ability to manage state in the parent or let Clay control the state of the component. You can [read more about this in our blog](/blog/2022/05/02/api-consistency-improvements-for-controlled-and-uncontrolled-components.html).

For the `<LanguagePicker />` component you can control the `selectedLocaleId` and `active` states by adding a state to your component, this is only advisable when you need this information otherwise don't use it.

If you just need to set the initial state of the `selectedLocaleId`, use the `defaultSelectedLocaleId` property which is appropriate for that use case. In case `defaultSelectedLocaleId` is not defined, it will take the first locale as the default locale.

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-info">
	<strong class="lead">Info</strong>
	The <code class="language-text">selectedLocaleId</code> property is equivalent
	to <code class="language-text">selectedKey</code> in the Picker, which is represented
	by the <code class="language-text">key</code> property configured in the <code class="language-text">
		Option
	</code> component, so the component can identify which value is selected and
	which should be shown in the trigger. <br />
</div>

```jsx
function Example() {
	// Controlled
	const [active, setActive] = useState(false);

	// Controlled
	const [selectedLocaleId, setSelectedLocaleId] = useState('');

	return (
		<LanguagePicker
			active={active}
			locales={[
				{
					id: 'en_US',
					label: 'en-US',
					name: 'English (United States)',
					symbol: 'en-us',
				},
				{
					id: 'ar_SA',
					label: 'ar-SA',
					name: 'Arabic (Saudi Arabia)',
					symbol: 'ar-sa',
				},
				{
					id: 'ca_ES',
					label: 'ca-ES',
					name: 'Catalan (Spain)',
					symbol: 'ca-es',
				},
				{
					id: 'nl_NL',
					label: 'nl-NL',
					name: 'Dutch (Netherlands)',
					symbol: 'nl-nl',
				},
			]}
			onActiveChange={setActive}
			onSelectedLocaleChange={setSelectedLocaleId}
			selectedLocaleId={selectedLocaleId}
		/>
	);
}
```

## Translations Variant

Unlike the default Language Picker, translations variant is used to select a translation from a list of translation languages that have been translated or not. An example of using this variant could be a form with one or more localizable fields, where we want to select and view the status of translations.

<LanguagePickerTranslationsExample />

This variant shows translation status labels next to each translation language to indicate the translation status for the content. The states are described below:

-   **Default**: Indentifies the default language. This default language is set with the property `defaultLocaleId`. If there is no `defaultLocaleId` it will take the first of the locales.
-   **Translated**: Used when all fields have been translated.
-   **Not Translated**: Used when none of the localizable fields have been translated.
-   **Translating x/x**: Used when at least one of the localizable fields of a content item has been translated. This label indicates the number of fields translated compared to the total number of fields.

## Trigger Options

### Trigger Without Language Label

You can customize the Language Picker trigger to display only the icon by setting the `hideTriggerText` property to true. This removes the language label.

<LanguagePickerOnlyIconExample />

### Small Trigger

You can reduce the size of the Language Picker trigger by setting the `small` property to `true`.

<LanguagePickerSmallExample />
