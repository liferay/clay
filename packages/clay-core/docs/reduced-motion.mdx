## Introduction

Setting the motion reduction of animations can be done in two different ways in Clay, transitions that are done purely in CSS can use the `c-prefers-reduced-motion` class and transitions that are made with JS are defined using Clay's `Provider` component.

## JS

To remove transition from components in React, you need to declare the [`Provider`](/docs/components/provider.html) component at the root of your application and set the `reducedMotion` property to whichever option you want.

-   `user`: Respect user's device setting.
-   `always`: Enforce reduced motion.
-   `never`: Don't reduce motion.

```jsx
import {Provider} from '@clayui/core';

<Provider spritemap={spritemap} reducedMotion="user">
	<App />
</Provider>;
```

## CSS

The class `c-prefers-reduced-motion` removes transitions from child elements. It allows the site creator to remove any CSS transition in a specific section or on the whole page without having to depend on the operating system's non-essential motion setting.

It also removes `scroll-behavior: smooth` if it is enabled. You can place `c-prefers-reduced-motion` on whatever element has the CSS property `scroll-behavior: smooth` to remove it. If this class is placed on the `html` element, it will remove all CSS transitions for the page.
