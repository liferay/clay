Clay is highly flexible so you can use the components in different applications with frameworks such as Angular, Vue and React, feel free to use the Clay standards in your application.

## Introduction

[WebComponents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components) is a web standard that is to be natively implemented in browsers in the future, so do not worry if you want to go that route. Clay gives you the ability to use the components as a Custom Elements in your HTML markup.

## Installation

You can start by choosing how to import your component by [npm](/docs/getting_started/importing-the-js-component.html) or [CDN](/docs/getting_started/cdn-links.html). You need to import the javascript of the component into your application in order for Clay to be included and rendered as a WebComponent component.

## Using

Once you import your component into your application, you just use it as an HTML TAG. Consider:

```text/html
<clay-button label="Primary" type="button"></clay-button>
```

## Examples
