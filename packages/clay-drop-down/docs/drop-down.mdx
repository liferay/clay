## Composing

DropDown's composition gives you the space to create more complex DropDowns, such as adding a form within DropDown, and creating simple DropDowns with the high-level `ClayDropDownWithItems` component that covers most basic Lexicon use cases.

<DropDown />

You may want to use only the content of DropDown for other cases, such as mounting an `Autocomplete`, so use `DropDown.Menu` instead of `DropDown` which gives you the flexibility to only control content without a trigger.

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	<code class="language-text">DropDown</code> consists of a{' '}
	<code class="language-text">DropDown.Menu</code> that controls the trigger
	and uses it as the basis for aligning DropDown content.
</div>

### Using dropdown without a trigger

You may want to create a trigger that is not necessarily in the same tree as DropDown, due to HTML markup issues, for these cases you can use `<ClayDropDown.Menu />`.

Using `<ClayDropDown.Menu />` allows you to better control the state of DropDown but you will have to deal with visibility, focus management, and other details.

```jsx
import ClayDropDown from '@clayui/drop-down';
import React, {useState, useRef} from 'react';

const Menu = ({children, hasLeftSymbols, hasRightSymbols}) => {
	const triggerElementRef = useRef(null);
	const [expand, setExpand] = useState(false);
	const menuElementRef = useRef(null);

	const handleExpand = (event) => {
		// This is not ideal for allowing you to have more than
		// one trigger for the same content but it simulates the
		// advantages of controlling `DropDown.Menu`.
		triggerElementRef.current = event.target;

		setExpand(!expand);
	};

	return (
		<div>
			<div>
				<button type="button" onClick={handleExpand}>
					Home
				</button>
			</div>
			<div>
				<button type="button" onClick={handleExpand}>
					Product
				</button>
			</div>

			<ClayDropDown.Menu
				active={expand}
				alignElementRef={triggerElementRef}
				hasLeftSymbols={hasLeftSymbols}
				hasRightSymbols={hasRightSymbols}
				onActiveChange={() => setExpand(!expand)}
				ref={menuElementRef}
			>
				{children}
			</ClayDropDown.Menu>
		</div>
	);
};
```

## DropDownWithItems

Allows you to create a simple DropDown, through its API you are able to create a Menu with groups of checkboxes and radios, links, buttons, search, caption, etc.

<DropDownWithItems />

### Cascading Menu

`DropDownWithItems` allows the possibility to create a contextual menu, the nature of the API allows the creation of more cascade menus but the **Lexicon specification recommends using only one level** and using `DropDownWithDrilldown` component.

To render a cascading menu it is necessary to set the `type` of the item to `contextual` and add to the `items` object that follows the same API as the other items.

```js
const items = [
	{label: 'Folder'},
	{type: 'divider'},
	{
		items: [
			{label: 'Basic Document'},
			{label: 'Contract'},
			{label: 'Marketing Banner'},
			{label: 'Spreadsheet'},
			{label: 'Presentation'},
		],
		label: 'Document',
		type: 'contextual',
	},
	{label: 'Shortcut'},
	{label: 'Repository'},
];
```

## DropDownWithDrilldown

A Drilldown menu allows the user to navigate to and/or select an element from a contextual list. It can be triggered by a dropdown button.

<DropDownWithDrilldown />

The way the Drilldown component links the menus is done via reference, the menu needs a unique `id`.

```js{expanded}
const menus = {
	of23: [{title: 'First'}],
};
```

From the `id` you are able to link to another menu using the `child` property.

```js{expanded}
const menus = {
	of23: [{title: 'First', child: 'of09'}],
	of09: [{title: 'Three'}],
};
```

If you want to add separators between your menu items, it's possible to do so, by
using an item that has this shape `{type: 'divider'}`.

```js{expanded}
const menus = {
	of23: [
		{title: 'First', child: 'of09'},
		{type: 'divider'},
		{title: 'Second'},
	],
	of09: [{title: 'Three'}],
};
```

<div class="clay-site-alert alert alert-warning">
	An important thing to have in mind, is that the `DropDownWithDrilldown`
	component, will render its menus in the order that they are specified. This
	means that if you specify the menus in the wrong order, the menu animation
	will not behave correctly.
</div>

## Caveats

One caveat with the drop down menu is that it is rendered inside of a [React Portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) and is rendered directly to the `body` element. This means if you are using the `menuWidth` prop set to `auto`, it will not respect the size of the node parent of the drop down, since the menu is rendered directly to the body.
