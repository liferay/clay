import {DualListBox} from '$clayui.com/src/components/clay/DualListBox';

`ClayDualListBox` is exported from the `@clayui/form` package, consisting of some low-level utilities that provides the ability to create a Select with multiple options selectable.

> Note: The actual select functionality will not work here due to a pending issue at [FormidableLabs/react-live#196](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live/issues/196). To see it in action, check out the [storybook demo](https://storybook.clayui.com/?path=/story/components-clayduallistbox--default).
