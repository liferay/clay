## Without Animation

By ommiting the `imgSrc` prop you will render a default Empty State component.
Even without an animation you can still pass in `children` to the component as seen with the `ClayButton` component in this example.

<EmptyState />

## With Animation

Adding an image to the component is easy, just point the `imgSrc` to the image you want to use

<EmptyStateWithImage />
