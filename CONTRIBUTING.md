## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?

### Clay and Packages

The Clay repository follows the monorepo approach; the pillars of Clay, all the major components, are in this one repository.

-   [clay-css](https://github.com/liferay/clay/blob/master/packages/clay-css) - Provides the colors and structure for Clay. It contains the CSS and example HTML markup for each component.
-   [clay-components](https://github.com/liferay/clay/blob/master/packages) - The components that follow clay-css markup and Lexicon use cases. They are developed on React.js in version 3.x.
-   [clayui.com](https://github.com/liferay/clay/blob/master/clayui.com) - Contains the source code and documentation for clayui.com.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section shows you how to submit an error report to Clay. Follow these guidelines so maintainers can clearly understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

-   **Check [existing issues](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+repo%3Aliferay%2Fclay)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [Github issues](https://github.com/liferay/clay/issues). Create an issue, and provide the information listed below so the maintainers can reproduce the problem:

-   **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue that identifies the problem.
-   **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
-   **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps**, and explain the problem with that behavior.
-   **Explain the desired behavior you expected and why.**
-   **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** if necessary.
-   **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a [CPU profile capture](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/rendering-tools/js-execution) with your report.
-   **If the problem only occurs in a specific browser**, specify the name and version of the browser.

Provide more context by answering this question:

-   **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how frequently the problem occurs and under which conditions it normally happens.

### Your First Pull Request

If you want to contribute to this project but you don't know where to begin, issues with the "[good first issue](https://github.com/liferay/clay/labels/good%20first%20issue)" label are a great place to start.

If you decide to fix an issue, please check the comment thread first to make sure that no one else is working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people don’t duplicate your effort.

### Proposing a Change

This section shows you how to propose a public API change, make non-trivial changes to the implementation, or propose something new. Follow these guidelines so maintainers can clearly understand your suggestion and your point of view.

#### Before Submitting a Suggestion for Improvement

-   **Check existing suggestions** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit a Suggestion for Improvement?

Suggestions for enhancement or API changes are tracked as [Github issues](https://github.com/liferay/clay/issues). Create an issue in this repository and provide the following information:

-   **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue that states your suggestion.
-   **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible.
-   **Describe the current behavior**, and explain the behavior you want to see instead and why.
-   **Provide details of the impact your change will make** and how you will use it.
-   **Provide the pros and cons of your change.**
-   **Provide at least one alternative for your change.**

### Sending a Pull Request

This section shows you how to send a pull request. The main staff are always monitoring pull requests, so rest assured that they will review yours. Follow these guidelines so the maintainers can complete a thorough review of your request.

> Be sure to check the accessibility tab of the Storybook to ensure accessibility tests are going pass.

#### Before Sending a Pull Request

-   Fork the repository and create your branch from **master**.
-   Run `yarn` at the root of the repository to install the project dependencies.
-   Run `yarn lerna` to install the dependencies of each package and link them together.
-   Run `yarn build` to build all packages.
-   **If you’ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!**
-   Run `yarn test` to ensure the test suite passes.
-   Run `yarn format` to format your code with Prettier.
-   Run `yarn lint` to make sure your code lints.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

This section shows you how to write commit messages in Clay. Follow these guidelines to help us maintain order and make it easier to locate your changes.

Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.

> Clay follows the "[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)" specification.

#### Type

-   **feat**: A new feature
-   **fix**: A bug fix
-   **docs**: Documentation-only changes
-   **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-   **chore**: Changes in the build process, auxiliary tools, libraries, tests or formatting

#### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `feat(@clayui/dropdown)`, `feat(@clayui/css)`, `fix(clayui.com)`, `docs(Badge)`, `fix(useCache)`, etc...

### JavaScript Style Guide

All JavaScript must adhere to the [Liferay JavaScript style guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-liferay).

### CSS Guidelines

See guidelines for [contribution with CSS](https://github.com/liferay/clay/blob/master/packages/clay-css/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Documentation Style Guide

Clay uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), obviating the need to write explicit [JSDOC](http://usejsdoc.org/) annotations for parameter and return types. We still write descriptions, however, for `interface`, `type`, `enum` etc to make it easier to use components.

```typescript
interface IProps {
	/**
	 * Default position of menu element. Values come from `metal-position`.
	 */
	alignmentPosition?: number;
}
```

## Additional Notes

### Issue Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us organize and track the issues.

Labels are organized by categories, such as the component the problem affects, the resolution, the status...

You may want to use [Github search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/) to find groups of issues you are interested in. For example, you may be interested in [open bug issues in Clay components](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+repo%3Aliferay%2Fclay+label%3A%22comp%3A+clay-components%22+label%3A%22type%3A+bug%22&type=Issues). Use this to create more focused queries.

## Release process

To publish a new version for all packages that have updated, follow these steps:

```bash
# Checkout latest
git checkout master

# Install dependencies and build css package
yarn
yarn workspace @clayui/css run build

# Make sure you have all of the tags from upstream.
git fetch $REMOTE --tags

# This updates each packages versions and makes proper version bumps
# based on its dependencies. The `--conventional-commits` flag should
# automatically determine what version each package should be updated to
lerna version --conventional-commits --no-push

# WARNING: If you see that the previous commands suggests an
# incorect version, for example a major version change, you
# should use this command instead:
# lerna version --no-push
# and set the version manually.

# Optionally, you might want to run `yarn checkDeps` to make sure the
# dependencies are in sync. Before you do that, you'll also want to
# remove any "old" build files, which can be done with
# find packages -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -name lib -type d | xargs rm -rf {}
# yarn checkDeps

# Create draft pull-request against `stable` (not intended to be merged)
# to the clay repo; this is to see CI green one last time.
# (Example below uses node-gh CLI tool)
gh pr --submit liferay --branch stable --draft

# Once CI is green, close the pull-request and merge changes to stable and master.
# If you want to see a preview first, use the `--dry-run` flag.
# (This assumes you are on the `master` branch)
git push $REMOTE master --follow-tags
git push $REMOTE master:stable

# Publish packages to NPM
lerna publish from-package

# Note: If this last step breaks, you may try running `lerna publish from-git` instead.
```

> NOTE: Publishing new packages automatically with Lerna is sometimes a problem, if you have problems try to publish the package separately manually.

### Releasing individual packages

In a rare case you may want to release only one specific package. Follow these steps:

Note: this is pretty rare to only release a single package, make sure you are only doing this as a last resort. Typically you should be able to just release everything at once.

```bash
# Checkout latest
git checkout master

# Navigate to specific package
cd ./packages/$COMPONENT_DIR

# Look at the git history of the package and determine if it relies on any
# non-released code from other packages.
#
# If it relies on other packages, you must publish those dependencies first following
# these same steps (start at step 1 with the dependent package).
#
# After you have published any dependencies needed

# Update Version.
# Any feat commits since last release require a minor version.
# If only chore or fix commits, a patch is required.
yarn version

# Create draft pull-request against `stable` (not intended to be merged)
# to the clay repo; this is to see CI green one last time.
# (Example below uses node-gh CLI tool)
gh pr --submit liferay --branch stable --draft

# Once CI is green, close the pull-request and merge changes to stable and master.
# If you want to see a preview first, use the `--dry-run` flag.
git push $REMOTE master --follow-tags

# Publish to NPM.
# Make sure you are in the directory of the package you want to publish.
yarn publish

# Congratulations! You should see successfully published packages.
#
# You may also need to do some post-publish administration and close
# the current Milestone in the Github interface,
#
# Closing the milestone will trigger a Github action to comment on each closed
# issue in the milestone, notifying that the issue is fixed and publicly
# available in the latest release.
```

Common Issues

-   You must have "publish" access for @clayui packages on NPM
-   Wrong node version. ([yarn build doesn't work on node v12](https://github.com/liferay/clay/issues/2053))

## Updating release in [liferay-portal](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal)

```bash
# Navigate
cd {PORTAL_ROOT}/modules/apps/frontend-taglib/frontend-taglib-clay

# Update clay dependencies in `package.json`
# Typically is easiest to use a package like
# https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates
#
# Note that sometimes there is a delay between publishing a package
# and it being seen on the registry. Make sure to verify all versions
# have been properly updated in the package.json.
ncu '/@clayui/' -u

# If you don't want to install `npm-check-updates` as a global package,
# you can also use this command
# npx npm-check-updates '/@clayui/' -u

# Run source formatter
#
# Often this will also update other files other than `package.json`
# files and the `yarn.lock`. Disregard changes to files other than those.
cd {PORTAL_ROOT}/portal-impl
ant format-source-all

# Update an dedup yarn.lock
cd {PORTAL_ROOT}/modules
yarn
npx yarn-deduplicate yarn.lock

# Verify yarn.lock stats
#
# If diff numbers are considerably off (more + then - or viceversa),
# review the contents to find an explanation
git diff --stat yarn.lock

# Update taglib markup if necessary
#
# Take a look at the markup changes in this new version of clay and make the
# corresponding changes to our serverside markup in `frontend-taglib-clay`.

# Run unit tests locally
# you may need to update snapshots for various modules
cd {PORTAL_ROOT}/modules
../gradlew packageRunTest

# Once all tests have passed, send a pull request!
#
# 1. Send pull request to https://github.com/liferay-frontend/liferay-portal
# 2. Copy the generated changelog and use that in your pull request description.
# 3. Link your pull request to the LPS ticket in the current Jira Epic.
#    - To find this, use the LPS from the Github milestone name and then look at
#     the linked issues. The LPS is typically called "Update Clay Dependencies"

# Lastly, share the release information in our public Slack channel!
```

## Testing local changes in liferay-portal

When working on an issue, you might want to test your changes before submitting
a pull request.

To test your changes in a liferay-portal (>= 7.3.x) environment you first need
to add the desired packages.

```bash
# Let's assume you have made a change in the clay-button component

# From the root of the clay repository, run
yarn workspace @clayui/button build

# Now navigate to the OSGI module where the component is used,
# in this case it's in the "frontend-taglib-clay" module:
cd {PORTAL_ROOT}/modules/apps/frontend-taglib/frontend-taglib-clay

# Link the @clayui/button package
yarn add file:PATH_TO_THE_PACKAGE

# Where PATH_TO_THE_PACKAGE is the absolute path of the package
# on your system, for example
# yarn add file:/home/me/clay/packages/clay-button

# Make sure you delete the "build" and "classes" directory
rm -rf build classes

# If you are in the "frontend-taglib-clay" module make sure you stop tomcat
# before deploying the module

# Deploy the module
gradlew deploy -a

# Restart tomcat
```

One you have tested your changes, you'll probably want to "roll back" to
use the package from npm (and not the one you changed for testing purposes).

In order to do so, checkout your changes

```bash
# Make sure you are in the directory where you made the previous changes,
# and have a look at what changed with

git status

# At that point, you should decide what to "undo" with git checkout
# For example
git checkout .

# The changes to the "global" yarn.lock file, will also need to be "undone"
git checkout ../../../yarn.lock

# Note that the relative path to the yarn.lock might be different

# Remove the "build" and "classes" directories
rm -rf build classes

# If you see a "node_modules" directory in your module, you can safely delete it too
rm -rf node_modules

# Re deploy your module
gradlew deploy -a
```
